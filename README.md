# GPT Latency

GPT Unicorn is a project that monitors OpenAI's GPT-4 model by measuring the latency of its responses to a set of prompts. The project aims to both track the changes and progress of the model over time by analyzing the latency of its responses, and to provide a public benchmark for the model's performance over time.
